6)change git flow because the new files are untracked
7)git add . then it will change to A(added)
8)git push -u origin main
The -u flag (or --set-upstream) is used to establish a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch.

It means that after you run this command once, you donâ€™t need to specify the remote and branch every time you run git push in the future. Git will automatically push to origin/main when you use git push in the future.
